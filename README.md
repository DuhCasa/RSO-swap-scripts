# RSO swap scripts

At the [RSO workshops](http://racunalniki.duh-casa.si/), harddisk images are cloned onto production harddrives, however as multiple disks are burned at the same time, the software used does not restore the swap UUID (by which it is mounted in the guest operating system) on all the drives correctly. These simple scripts reset partition data of the first partition on the drive (which is where we put our swap) to Linux-swap with the UUID used in the guest operating system.
